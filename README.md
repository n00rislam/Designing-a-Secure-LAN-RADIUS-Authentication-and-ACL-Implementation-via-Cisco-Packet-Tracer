# 🔐 Secure Local Area Network Design  

## 🖥️ Simulation of RADIUS Server and ACL Implementation Using Cisco Packet Tracer  

### 📌 Project Overview  
This repository contains a **secure LAN network design** that integrates:  
- **Two Local Area Networks (LANs)** connected via a router with different subnets.  
- **RADIUS Server** for centralized **authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA)** to enhance network security.  
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to regulate network traffic, ensuring that only authorized devices can communicate.  
- **Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file** to visualize and test the network configuration.  

### 🔍 Features Implemented  
✔ **LAN Segmentation:** Two separate subnets, each with assigned **default gateways**.  
✔ **Router Configuration:** Ensuring proper communication between LANs with secured routing.  
✔ **RADIUS Server Integration:** Enhancing security by restricting access to **authorized users only**.  
✔ **ACL Configuration:** Allowing and restricting traffic based on security policies.  
✔ **Packet Tracer Simulation:** Providing a **realistic test environment** to analyze network security.

### 📜 How to Use  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHub/Secure_LAN_Design.git
   cd Secure_LAN_Design
2. Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Analyze the network topology and review device configurations.
4. Test RADIUS authentication by attempting remote login.
5. Check ACL restrictions by sending pings between different LANs.
6. Modify and experiment with configurations as needed.
