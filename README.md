# Designing-a-Secure-LAN-RADIUS-Authentication-and-ACL-Implementation-via-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
🔐 Secure Local Area Network Design
🖥️ Simulation of RADIUS Server and ACL Implementation Using Cisco Packet Tracer
📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a secure LAN network design that integrates:

Two Local Area Networks (LANs) connected via a router with different subnets.
RADIUS Server for centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) to enhance network security.
Access Control Lists (ACLs) to regulate network traffic, ensuring that only authorized devices can communicate.
Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file to visualize and test the network configuration.
🔍 Features Implemented
✔ LAN Segmentation: Two separate subnets, each with assigned default gateways.
✔ Router Configuration: Ensuring proper communication between LANs with secured routing.
✔ RADIUS Server Integration: Enhancing security by restricting access to authorized users only.
✔ ACL Configuration: Allowing and restricting traffic based on security policies.
✔ Packet Tracer Simulation: Providing a realistic test environment to analyze network security.

📜 How to Use
1️⃣ Open Secure_LAN_Design.pkt in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2️⃣ Analyze the network topology and review device configurations.
3️⃣ Test RADIUS authentication by attempting remote login.
4️⃣ Check ACL restrictions by sending pings between different LANs.
5️⃣ Modify and experiment with configurations as needed.
